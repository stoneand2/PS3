#### Problem 1 (S3) ####
# Define a new class: door. Objects of this class simply take on one numeric value: 
# 1, 2, or 3 â€“ indicating which door a candidate chooses.

## Function for creating a new list object of the class "door"
#'
#' This function takes an optional input that is an integer of the value 1, 2, or 3, corresponding to 
#' a door choice in the Let's Make a Deal game. 
#' 
#' @param whichdoor (optional) An integer of the value 1, 2, or 3. If a value is input that is not
#' one of these values, the function will automatically choose one of the three values for the user.
#' 
#' @return A list of the class "door" with the element choice, where choice has one element, equal to 
#' 1, 2, or 3.

Door_Object <- function(whichdoor=NA){
  if(whichdoor %in% c(1,2,3)){
    doorchoice <- list(choice=whichdoor)
    class(doorchoice) <- "door"
    return(doorchoice)
  }
  else{
    draw <- sample(c(1,2,3), 1)
    doorchoice <- list(choice=draw)
    class(doorchoice) <- "door"
    print(paste("You didn't pick one of the doors. So, your door was randomly assigned to be", draw))
    return(doorchoice)
  }
}

# object.door <- Door_Object()
# class(object.door)


#### Problem 2 (S3) #### 
# Create a method for door objects that is called PlayGame. 
# This method is supposed to do the following:

# Take the numeric value that is stored in the door object,

# draw a random number between 1 and 3 that presents the door
# behind which the car is hidden,

# compare the two numbers, and print a message congratulating a winning candidate 
# that chose the correct door, or expressing sympathies for a losing candidate that chose the 
# wrong door.


## Creates a generic function PlayGame.
#'
#' This function is the generic for PlayGame methods.  
#' 
#' @param x An object input. 
#' 
#' @author Andy Stone.

# Creating a generic
PlayGame <- function(x){
  UseMethod("PlayGame", x)
}

## Creates a default method for the PlayGame generic. 
#'
#' This function is the default method for PlayGame. If no specific method exists for the class of 
#' the object passed to PlayGame, it will call this function. It will warn the user that no method 
#' exists for an object of the class passed to the function.
#' 
#' @param x An object input. 
#' 
#' @return The object passed to the function.
#' 
#' @author Andy Stone.

# Backup default method
PlayGame.default <- function(x){
  print("This object doesn't have an associated PlayGame method. This is the default response.
        Try methods('PlayGame') to see objects with a PlayGame method.")
  return(x)
}

## Creates a method for the PlayGame generic for objects of the class "door."
#'
#' This function creates a PlayGame method for objects of the class "door," allowing the user to play
#' a simplified version of Let's Make a Deal. The input is an object of the class "door," which
#' should have the element choice with one element equal to 1, 2, or 3. Such an object can be created 
#' using the Door_Object() function. The function randomly draws a winning door equal to 1, 2, or 3. It
#' then checks to see whether the user's choice is equal to the winning door or not. It then reveals
#' whether the user wins or loses, and prints a web link letting the user know what their prize looks 
#' like. 
#' 
#' @param x A list object of the class "door."
